BetterWOMAN has been the answer to my prayers. I hate taking medicine, especially prescriptions.
And this relieves me of the worry of getting too many chemicals into my body.
It works wonders once it gets into your system. That takes time but it is worth it in the long run.
Thank you.<cite>June, K. 55</cite>
