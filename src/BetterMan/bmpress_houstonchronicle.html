        <h3><b>'Herbal Viagra' Passes Rat Test <br />
          Anti-impotence supplement shows promise </b></h3>
        <p><i>HOUSTON CHRONICLE</i>, SUNDAY, OCTOBER 29, 2000 <br />
          By Richard Saltus Globe Staff </p>
        <p>A concoction touted as an &quot;herbal Viagra&quot; without the side effects has 
          shown it can prevent impotence in rats, giving at least a measure of scientific 
          support to the briskly selling product known as &quot;BetterMAN&quot;.</p>
        <p>Developed by a Marblehead biologist born in China and familiar with traditional 
          remedies, the supplement is aimed at two of middle-age men's biggest complaints 
          &#150; erectile difficulties and frequent nighttime trips to the bathroom.</p>
        <p>Though mainstream researchers are skeptical, BetterMAN's developer, Peipei 
          Wu Wishnow, claims it can restore and maintain male potency while also 
          reducing the need to urinate at night that occurs in many older men with 
          enlarged prostate glands.</p>
        <p>Unlike Viagra, the blockbuster impotence drug that men take an hour or 
          two before sex, BetterMAN is taken daily with rest periods of a few days. 
          By some mechanism that isn't understood, the herbs affect the man's physiology 
          to restore sexual potency without the need for before-sex treatment each 
          time.</p>
        <p>Thus, an erection seems &quot;like a normal reaction&quot; because the herbal brew 
          &quot;is not like something you have to take and wait,&quot; said one user, a 72-year-old 
          retired military man from the Boston area who requested anonymity.</p>
        <p>&quot;This increases the spontaneity and frequency&quot; of sex compared to the 
          delayed action of Viagra, said Wishnow.</p>
        <p>However, until now, proof of BetterMAN's effectiveness has been scant. 
          Although Wishnow reports good results in a small sample of men, the product 
          has not undergone any stringent or large-scale clinical testing, as would 
          a prescription drug, and the Food and Drug Administration doesn't allow 
          such food supplements to be advertised with medical claims.</p>
        <p>But BetterMAN can produce a better rat, according to the study published 
          in the Journal of Urology &#150; that is, a rat whose potency isn't diminished 
          by the same fatty diet that hampered erections in rodents that didn't 
          get the product.</p>
        <p>The lead author of the report, Dr. Tom Lue, a urologist at the University 
          of California in San Francisco, said he was approached by Wishnow's company, 
          Interceuticals, and he agreed to test the product because of an interest 
          in herbal remedies fostered by his father, who was a Chinese herbalist.</p>
        <p>After months of feeding the animals a high-cholesterol diet, Lue used 
          an electrical current to stimulate erections in the animals. The rats 
          that didn't get BetterMAN had only half the normal erections as those 
          that got the herb treatment, Lue reported.</p>
        <p>&quot;What the mechanism is, we don't know,&quot; said Lue. But the experiment 
          ruled out a placebo effect because the rats were under anesthesia during 
          the testing.</p>
        <p>Lue said he would not recommend BetterMAN for people without more testing, 
          but several independent pharmacists in the Boston area estimated that 
          hundreds of their customers were using the remedy, a mixture of 18 herbs, 
          and reporting good results.</p>
        <p>The herbal remedy usually begins to show benefits after about two months 
          of daily use, said Wishnow, a biologist who did graduate work at MIT and 
          the California Institute of Technology. The cost of treatment with the 
          herbs is about $40 a month and is available at Wishnow's Web site, www.BetterMANnow.com.</p>
        <p>Viagra costs about $10 per pill. Some insurers cover a limited supply 
          of Viagra, often four pills per month. If a man wanted to use it more 
          often, he would have to pay out of pocket and at that point the herbal 
          remedy might be cheaper since it has a fixed cost.</p>
