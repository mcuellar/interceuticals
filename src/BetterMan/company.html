        <p><b><img src="Images/lev2/pwishnowcolor.jpg" alt="Peipei Wu Wishnow, Ph.D." width="90" height="115" align="right" />Founder 
          and President of Interceuticals, Inc. <br />
        Peipei Wu Wishnow, Ph.D. </b></p>
        <p>When I started Interceuticals, Inc. back in 1997, I was often asked &quot;why,&quot; 
          as a woman biologist, I choose BetterMAN&reg; as the flagship product 
          for the company. Remember, 1997 was the pre-Viagra&reg; era, the erectile 
          function issue was rarely discussed publicly. </p>
        <p>I wanted to build a company based on trust, and our first product must 
          be able to deliver that trust, with a safety profile and health benefits 
          noticeable to our customers. BetterMAN can build that trust.</p>
        <p>I was born in China into a family with three generations of medical professionals. 
          My grandfather was a well-known herbalist&#151;his medical merit saved 
          his life from the persecution of the Communists in the early 1950s. My 
          parents are both physicians. I firmly believe that Traditional Chinese 
          Medicine (TCM) has much to offer the healthcare needs of the world. As 
          a Western trained professional, I also realize that certain aspects of 
          TCM can benefit from Western scientific methods and technology. </p>
        <p>After receiving my doctorate in biology in the United States and spending 
          years as a researcher at MIT, CalTech and in the pharmaceutical industry, 
          I clearly saw the value modern Western pharmaceutical companies offer 
          consumers. At the same time, I started to realize the limitations of pharmaceutical 
          drugs. Very often, drugs have many side effects. Most importantly, they 
          are not appropriate for people who want to take a proactive, natural approach 
          to improve their health. I founded Interceuticals to bridge the gap between 
          these two health care cultures.</p>
        <p><b>Company Philosophy<br />
          </b>Our mission is to apply Western scientific methods and quality control 
          to time-tested, efficacious TCM formulas. Our goal is to provide a line
          of high quality TCM products for health conscious consumers like yourself 
          to improve your quality of life naturally. </p>
