        <h2>Treatment advances for millions with urinary problem</h2>
        <p>By Kathleen Nelson, Globe Correspondent, 12/2/2003</p>
        <p>One out of every three women over 45 has an embarrassing problem when 
          she sneezes, lifts a heavy bag or swings a golf club: She pees.</p>
        <p>This loss of control, called stress urinary incontinence, leaves many 
          of its 15 million victims &#150; most of whom are women &#150; feeling 
          ashamed and frustrated. More than half the women questioned in a poll 
          this fall were so uncomfortable about the leakages they hadn't even discussed 
          them with their doctor.</p>
        <p>And, until recently, women who did tell their doctors were told there 
          was little medical science could do to help.</p>
        <p>But now treatment ranging from simple exercises to surgery are showing 
          that those who develop stress urinary incontinence aren't stuck with it 
          forever.</p>
        <p>&quot;Incontinence is not a normal part of aging,&quot; said Dr. Stephen Young, 
          chief of the division of urogynecology and reconstructive pelvic surgery 
          at UMass Memorial Medical Center in Worcester.</p>
        <p>The leakages, which are more common among women who have given birth, 
          are caused by a weakening of the muscles and connective tissue that support 
          the bladder and help close the urethral sphincter. Any physical activity 
          that changes abdominal pressure can push the urethra down and open, causing 
          a leak, Young said.</p>
        <p>Strengthening the pelvic floor muscles through Kegel exercises is a good 
          first step in treating stress incontinence, and sometimes the only one 
          that's needed, said Dr. Patricia Goode of the Department of Veterans Affairs 
          Medical Center in Birmingham, Ala.</p>
        <p>Lifestyle modifications such as keeping fit, emptying the bladder regularly, 
          and avoiding caffeine and foods or medicines with diuretic effects also
          may work for some people.</p>
        <p>Seeking expert advice can also help. Urogynecologists like Young specialize 
          in caring for women with pelvic floor problems. In a &quot;urodynamics visit,&quot;
          the doctor may thread a very thin catheter with a microtip sensor through 
          the urethra and record pressure in the bladder and sphincter. The process 
          doesn't cause any pain, Young said, and helps tailor the treatment to 
          the patient's diagnosis.</p>
        <p>If noninvasive therapies fail, there are surgical options, too. Young's 
          operation of choice for complicated forms of stress incontinence, the 
          PuboVaginal Sling, holds up the urethra and bladder neck with a hammock 
          and has a cure rate of 94 percent. A newer, minimally invasive operation 
          called tension-free vaginal tape inserts a mesh under the urethra to hold 
          it up, and 85 percent of those treated remain &quot;cured&quot; after five years, 
          said Young, who has published several studies on incontinence surgery.</p>
        <p>Other surgeries include stabilizing and elevating the urethra with permanent
          stitches or attaching it to the abdominal connective tissue (rectus fascia) 
          via long needles. Collagen injections that bulk up the urethral sphincter 
          can help women with very weak urethras, and for men who suffer from stress 
          incontinence from prostate surgery, sometimes an artificial sphincter 
          is created. These and other surgical treatments come with potential down 
          sides of temporary urinary urgency, difficulty emptying the bladder, or 
          erosion of the synthetic sling materials.</p>
        <p>There are no pharmaceutical treatments yet for stress incontinence (the 
          ones on the market help with urge incontinence, a different condition) 
          but duloxetine has shown promise in preliminary studies. Duloxetine, a 
          combined serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, may improve 
          nerve impulses that squeeze the sphincter shut. Pharmaceutical companies 
          Eli Lilly and Co. and Boehringer Ingleheim are manufacturing the drug 
          and expect FDA approval next year.</p>
        <p><b>A Chinese herbal formula called BetterWOMAN, developed by Dr. Peipei
          Wu Wishnow, founder of the Marblehead-based company, Interceuticals Inc., 
          claims to improve incontinence and urinary frequency, with the abstract 
          of a small clinical study published in the November-December issue of 
          Menopause journal.</b></p>
        <p>Diane Newman, an advanced nurse practitioner and the codirector of the 
          Penn Center for Continence and Pelvic Health at the University of Pennsylvania, 
          said many of her patients have waited years to seek treatment. That shouldn't 
          be the case, she said. &quot;My hope is that women learn the symptoms of stress 
          urinary incontinence, feel comfortable talking about it, and bring it 
          up with their doctor, because this problem is treatable.&quot;</p>
