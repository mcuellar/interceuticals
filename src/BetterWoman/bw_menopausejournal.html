        <p><b>Objectives:</b> Incontinence affects over 16 millions of American 
          women, mostly menopausal or post-menopausal women. This study is designed 
          to evaluate the effect of a Chinese herbal formula BetterWOMAN on female
          urinary incontinence including stress urinary incontinence, urge incontinence, 
          and frequent urination. <b>Design:</b> Forty-five females aged from 35 
          to 78 participated the study. A Self-Assessment Questionnaire was used 
          to quantitatively evaluate each participant's results based on the pre- 
          and post- BetterWOMAN treatment symptom scores. For each parameter tested, 
          the number of total qualified participant is the number of participants 
          with a pre-treatment symptom score FREQUENTLY or worse. To qualify as 
          &quot;reported improved&quot;, a participant's post-treatment symptom 
          score must be OCCASIONALLY or better. McNemar chi-squared statistic method 
          was used for data analysis. The treatment dosage was one 400 mg capsule 
          twice a day for 60 days with a 3-day break without capsules every 20 days. <b>Results:</b> From 45 participants, 38 complete data points were collected 
          (n=38) after 60 days. The demographic distribution is 26.3% younger than 
          44 and 73.3% over 45 years old. 86.8% participants are menopausal or post-menopausal 
          women. The data shows that 76% reported decreased symptom of stress urinary 
          incontinence (n=21, p&lt;0.05); 70% reported decreased urinary urgency (n=20); 
          and 73% reported decreased urinary frequency (n=15). No negative side 
          effects were reported. <b>Conclusion:</b> The study provides evidence
          that BetterWOMAN significantly reduced female stress urinary incontinence
          after a 60-day treatment. Over seventy percent (70 %) of participants 
          reported reduced urinary urgency and urinary frequency. Based on the Traditional 
          Chinese Medicine (TCM) theory, BetterWOMAN may improve the tonality and 
          strength of the muscle systems that support the bladder functions by improving 
          blood circulation, modulating hormone rebalance and modulating neuromuscular 
          functions. </p>
