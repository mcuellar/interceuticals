      <h2>Treatment advances for millions with urinary problem</h2>
      <p>By Kathleen Nelson, Globe Correspondent, 12/2/2003</p>
      <p>One out of every three women over 45 has an embarrassing problem when 
        she sneezes, lifts a heavy bag or swings a golf club: She pees.</p>
      <p>This loss of control, called stress urinary incontinence, leaves many 
        of its 15 million victims &#150; most of whom are women &#150; feeling 
        ashamed and frustrated. More than half the women questioned in a poll 
        this fall were so uncomfortable about the leakages they hadn't even discussed 
        them with their doctor.</p>
      <p>And, until recently, women who did tell their doctors were told there 
        was little medical science could do to help.</p>
      <p>But now treatment ranging from simple exercises to surgery are showing 
        that those who develop stress urinary incontinence aren't stuck with it 
        forever.</p>
      <p>"Incontinence is not a normal part of aging," said Dr. Stephen Young, 
        chief of the division of urogynecology and reconstructive pelvic surgery 
        at UMass Memorial Medical Center in Worcester.</p>
      <p>The leakages, which are more common among women who have given birth, 
        are caused by a weakening of the muscles and connective tissue that support 
        the bladder and help close the urethral sphincter. Any physical activity 
        that changes abdominal pressure can push the urethra down and open, causing 
        a leak, Young said.</p>
      <p>Strengthening the pelvic floor muscles through Kegel exercises is a good 
        first step in treating stress incontinence, and sometimes the only one 
        that's needed, said Dr. Patricia Goode of the Department of Veterans Affairs 
        Medical Center in Birmingham, Ala.</p>
      <p>Lifestyle modifications such as keeping fit, emptying the bladder regularly, 
        and avoiding caffeine and foods or medicines with diuretic effects also 
        may work for some people.</p>
      <p>Seeking expert advice can also help. Urogynecologists like Young specialize 
        in caring for women with pelvic floor problems. In a "urodynamics visit," 
        the doctor may thread a very thin catheter with a microtip sensor through 
        the urethra and record pressure in the bladder and sphincter. The process 
        doesn't cause any pain, Young said, and helps tailor the treatment to 
        the patient's diagnosis.</p>
      <p>If noninvasive therapies fail, there are surgical options, too. Young's 
        operation of choice for complicated forms of stress incontinence, the 
        PuboVaginal Sling, holds up the urethra and bladder neck with a hammock 
        and has a cure rate of 94 percent. A newer, minimally invasive operation 
        called tension-free vaginal tape inserts a mesh under the urethra to hold 
        it up, and 85 percent of those treated remain "cured" after five years, 
        said Young, who has published several studies on incontinence surgery.</p>
      <p>Other surgeries include stabilizing and elevating the urethra with permanent 
        stitches or attaching it to the abdominal connective tissue (rectus fascia) 
        via long needles. Collagen injections that bulk up the urethral sphincter 
        can help women with very weak urethras, and for men who suffer from stress 
        incontinence from prostate surgery, sometimes an artificial sphincter 
        is created. These and other surgical treatments come with potential down 
        sides of temporary urinary urgency, difficulty emptying the bladder, or 
        erosion of the synthetic sling materials.</p>
      <p>There are no pharmaceutical treatments yet for stress incontinence (the 
        ones on the market help with urge incontinence, a different condition) 
        but duloxetine has shown promise in preliminary studies. Duloxetine, a 
        combined serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, may improve 
        nerve impulses that squeeze the sphincter shut. Pharmaceutical companies 
        Eli Lilly and Co. and Boehringer Ingleheim are manufacturing the drug 
        and expect FDA approval next year.</p>
      <p><b>A Chinese herbal formula called BetterWOMAN, developed by Dr. Peipei 
        Wu Wishnow, founder of the Marblehead-based company, Interceuticals Inc., 
        claims to improve incontinence and urinary frequency, with the abstract 
        of a small clinical study published in the November-December issue of 
        Menopause journal.</b></p>
      <p>Diane Newman, an advanced nurse practitioner and the codirector of the 
        Penn Center for Continence and Pelvic Health at the University of Pennsylvania, 
        said many of her patients have waited years to seek treatment. That shouldn't 
        be the case, she said. "My hope is that women learn the symptoms of stress 
        urinary incontinence, feel comfortable talking about it, and bring it 
        up with their doctor, because this problem is treatable."</p>
      <p><i>The National Association For Continence recently launched an online 
        forum for discussion of incontinence at www.bladder-control-forum.com.
