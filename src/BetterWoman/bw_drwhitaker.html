        <p><b>BETTERWOMAN FOR INCONTINENCE</b>. Urinary incontinence affects nearly 
          13 million American adults, including approximately half of all nursing 
          home residents and homebound elderly people. Contrary to popular belief, 
          incontinence is not an inevitable part of aging. Excellent therapies I've 
          written about in the past include Kegel exercises to strengthen the muscles 
          of the pelvic floor and acupuncture. Here's another one: BetterWOMAN, 
          a blend of Chinese herbs that modulates hormones, boosts neuromuscular 
          function, and increases circulation in the muscles involved in bladder 
          support, resulting in better urinary control.</p>
        <p>One study looked at 38 women, ages 35 to 78, who suffered from stress 
          incontinence (brought on by laughing, sneezing, etc.), frequent urination, 
          or urgency (the immediate and urgent need to urinate). After using BetterWOMAN 
          for two months, 76 percent of the women suffering from stress incontinence 
          noticed marked improvement, as did 70 percent of those with urgency problems. 
          And frequent bathroom trips were reduced in 73 percent of the study participants. 
          Look for BetterWOMAN in your health food store or purchase it from the
          manufacturer by calling (888) 686 2698 or online at betterwomannnow.com.</p>
