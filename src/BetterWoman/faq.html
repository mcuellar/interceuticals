        <p><b><a name="1" id="1"></a>What are the major types of bladder control issues?</b><br />
          There are three major types of bladder control issues. (1) Leakage of 
          small amounts of urine while you sneeze, cough or exercise. (2) Leakage 
          of large amounts of urine while you feel a sudden urge to urinate. (3) 
          Frequent urination. Many women have mixed types of bladder control issues. </p>
        <p>While bladder control problems affect women and men of all age groups, 
          it happens mostly to women. Research suggests that involuntary urine loss 
          affects 16 million American women (National Family Opinion, August 2001), 
          and the incidence increases as women age. </p>

        <p><b><a name="3" id="3"></a>Why do bladder control issues happen?</b> <br />
          Bladder control issues may be caused by medical conditions such as Multiple 
          Scleroses, Diabetes, Alzheimer Disease or surgeries. These medical conditions 
          may damage the nerve systems that control the bladder functions. People 
          with bladder control issues should check with physicians for potential 
          underlying medical conditions. </p>
        <p>Bladder control issues mostly happen to menopausal and post-menopausal 
          women, and to younger women after multiple childbirths. Hormone changes
          and the birthing process may weaken the tone and strength of the muscle 
          systems that control the bladder functions. The major muscle groups involved 
          in the bladder functioning such as sphincter muscles, bladder wall muscles, 
          and pelvic muscles are shown in the two figures below. When these muscles
          are weakened, bladder control will become a problem. </p>

          Clearinghouse) </p>
        <p>Many women are told that bladder control issues and urine loss are part 
          of getting old. Many women are so embarrassed by the &quot;accidents&quot; and just 
          use protective pads to get by. Based on Consumer Report (October 1997), 
          only 25% of women with involuntary urine loss issues sought help. </p>
        <p>It is absolutely not necessary to continue to suffer in silence. Bladder 
          control can be regained. You can have your dependable body back. You may 
          try Kegel exercises or behavior training techniques to strengthen pelvic 
          muscles and improve bladder control. Now, BetterWOMAN is available to 
          help you to regain bladder control naturally! </p>

        <p><b>H<a name="5" id="5"></a>ow can BetterWOMAN help me?</b> <br />
          Featured on WebMD, BetterWOMAN is the first clinically tested natural 
          supplement shown effective in improving female bladder control.</p>
        <p>BetterWOMAN reduces involuntary urine leakage, urinary urgency, and frequent 
          urination. The success rate is 80% after 2 months of usage. </p>
        <p>In a recent study of forty-five American women, aged 34 to 74, an overwhelming 
          majority of women reported noticeable improvements after just 3 bottles 
          (2 months) of BetterWOMAN. Some women even started to notice improvements 
          within 10 days (see <a href="content.aspx?CTF=testimonials&amp;a_menu=testimonial&amp;a_image=testimonial">Testimonials</a>). </p>
        <p>Participants took a self-assessment questionnaire before and after taking 
          BetterWOMAN. (Click <a href="content.aspx?CTF=urinarytest&amp;a_image=bw">here</a> to view the questionnaire). 
          For a participant to be considered &quot;reported improved&quot; in a 
          specific parameter, her scores must change from &quot;Always&quot; to 
          &quot;Occasionally&quot;, or from &quot;Frequent&quot; to &quot;Rarely&quot;. 
          Data points were tabulated by independent third party. The study results 
          are summarized in the following figure:</p>
        <p><img src="images/level2/bladdercontrolchart.jpg" alt="Bladder Control Chart" width="250" height="200" /></p>
        <p>Some longer-term users (3 to 4 months) also reported increased energy 
          levels, sexual libido and vaginal lubrication. Individual results may 
          vary on sexual benefits. </p>
        <p>BetterWOMAN is formulated for women by a woman. Peipei Wishnow, Ph.D. 
          (see <a href="content.aspx?CTF=company&amp;a_menu=company&amp;a_image=company">Company</a>) is trained in U.S. pharmaceutical 
          practices, but she also makes use of her heritage. As a third-generation 
          Chinese medical professional, she understands the value of traditional 
          herbal preparations as an integral part of healthcare options. Dr. Wishnow's
          BetterWOMAN supplement is based on Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) 
          theory and has over 50 years of scientific and clinical support data. </p>

        <p><a name="6" id="6"></a><b>How does BetterWOMAN work? </b><br />
          BetterWOMAN naturally improves blood circulation, promotes hormone balance 
          and modulates neuromuscular functions, based on Traditional Chinese Medicine 
          theory. It improves the tone and strength of muscle systems that control 
          the bladder functions. The stronger the muscles, the better the bladder
          controls. </p>
        <p><a href="#top"><img src="images/level2/backtotopbutton.gif" width="96" height="18" border="0" alt="Back to Top" /></a></p>
        <p><b><a name="8" id="8"></a>Is it safe to take BetterWOMAN?</b> <br />
          There are no known side effects for taking BetterWOMAN. There are no known 
          contraindications with common medications. </p>
        <p>BetterWOMAN contains no hormones or stimulants. All Chinese herbs used 
          in the BetterWOMAN formula are pure, natural with over 50 years of safe 
          and effective use. In a toxicity study, no abnormality was observed in 
          lab animals fed with 330 folds of the human dosage of BetterWOMAN powder.</p>
        <p>BetterWOMAN is manufactured in the USA under cGMP standards. Each batch 
          of the product is assayed and guaranteed with no heavy metal contaminations. </p>
        <p><b>General Warning</b>: Keep the bottle out of the reach of children. 
          Consult a health care professional if you are on any medications or prone 
          to allergic reactions. Do not use if you are pregnant or nursing. </p>
        <p><a href="#top"><img src="images/level2/backtotopbutton.gif" width="96" height="18" border="0" alt="Back to Top" /></a></p>
        <p><b><a name="8a" id="8a"></a>How should I take BetterWOMAN?</b><br />
          Each bottle of BetterWOMAN contains 40 capsules. Take 1 capsule after 
          breakfast and 1 after dinner. The minimum recommended dosage is 3 bottles 
          (2 months). Take a 3-day break between each bottle. Continue use thereafter 
          for ongoing improvements. </p>
        <p><b><a name="9" id="9"></a>Do I have to take BetterWOMAN forever?</b><br />
          If you feel very comfortable with your regained bladder control, you can 
          take a break from using BetterWOMAN until you feel you need it again. 
          The benefits will not go away immediately. However since the human body 
          is a metabolizing machine, you may have to replenish your system based 
          on your individual need. </p>
        <p>The best approach is to take BetterWOMAN on a regular basis. BetterWOMAN 
          not only specifically improves bladder control but also systematically 
          provides anti-aging benefits for women via improving blood circulation 
          and modulating hormone balance naturally, especially for women over 45 
          years old. While the body is still full of vitality, the aging process 
          starts to kick in and the biologic system starts slowly going down hill. 
          It is important to provide the body some help to slow down the aging process. 
          BetterWOMAN can help you. </p>
