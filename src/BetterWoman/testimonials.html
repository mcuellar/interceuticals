        <p><b>Lawrence Dorman, DO, Applewood Medical Center, Missouri</b> &#150; 
          &quot;The majority of my patients (ranging in age from 37 to 73) have 
          noticed dramatic improvements in their urinary control issues within 4 
          to 8 weeks of taking BetterWOMAN. One patient has MS with several years 
          of incontinence history. After one bottle, she started to see improvements. 
          Another patient is in a wheel chair due to a rare neuronal disease. Her 
          incontinence symptom was greatly relieved after 60 days. I am very happy 
          with the results.&quot; </p>
        <p><b>P. Cutler, MD, PC. Niagara Falls, NY</b> &#150; &quot;I am very happy 
          with the responses from my patients. They are mostly women over 60, and 
          many of them saw improvements within 20 days. One young 28-year-old woman 
          had severe stress urinary incontinence with undetectable health conditions. 
          She did not respond to hormone treatment. I treated her with BetterWOMAN, 
          and her stress incontinence stopped completely within one month.&quot; </p>
        <p><b>Gary Kracoff, R.Ph. Johnson Drug, Waltham, MA</b> &#150; &quot;I never 
          realized how big this problem was. We have already had many better women! 
          The majority of the customers start to see improvements within the first 
          10-20 days. Nearly all customers have continued to use BetterWOMAN. A 
          woman in her 70s told me that she was housebound, and now she can go out 
          and enjoy her life again. What a relief!&quot; </p>

        <p><b>Marian, 60</b> <b>&#150; a case with over 30 years of bladder control 
          problems.</b> &quot;I started to notice bladder control problems 30 years 
          ago after I had a C-section. Ten years ago, I had a hysterectomy. After 
          that, incontinence became a big problem. I did not know when an accident 
          would happen. I was afraid to go out, even with pads. I started to seek 
          medical treatment about 4 years ago and had been taking medication for 
          4 years. One drug helped me a bit, but made me very dry. I felt my throat
          was on fire all the time. My husband saw BetterWOMAN information and bought 
          3 bottles for me to try. I noticed very obvious improvement within just 
          days. Now I am on my 4th bottle, I am off the medication, and I can go 
          out without being afraid. I am so happy!&quot; </p>
        <p><b>Marian, 44 &#150; a typical case for women after multiple childbirth.</b> &quot;Like many of my girl friends, I started to experience slight urine 
          leakage after I had my second child. After the third child, the situation 
          became more of an issue. I noticed leakage when I sneeze, laugh, or when 
          I get out bed in the morning. Gradually, I also started to notice urgency 
          in urination when I entered into the peri -menopausal phase. I thought 
          this was part of the aging process until I tried BetterWOMAN. It took 
          me a while to notice improvement. In the beginning, I noticed almost nothing. 
          While I was on the third bottle, my urinary urgency greatly improved. 
          On my 4th bottle, I felt I did not have the leakage any more when I laugh 
          or sneeze. I am in my 6th bottle now and I have started to notice an improvement 
          in my libido. It has calmed my peri-menopausal symptoms such as hot flashes 
          and night sweats. I am very happy with BetterWOMAN. I am convinced. I 
          believe in a product that works slowly into my system rather than hormone 
          replacement.&quot; </p>
        <p><b>Jennifer &#150; a typical case of women in mid 50s.</b> &quot;I am 
          54. In the last 6 months my symptoms were a) take a sip of anything and 
          need to go &quot;immediately&quot;, which is especially difficult if you are driving! 
          b) Had trouble holding it when trying to find a bathroom fast, c) had 
          to go constantly, d) incontinence when cough or sneeze, e) going 1-3 times 
          during the night. I went into Olivers Market in Cotati and asked the girl 
          in the vitamin department if there was anything to help urinary issues. 
          She recommended BetterWoman. I had immediate results on my first bottle; 
          it helped me to not have to go &quot;immediately&quot;, and not so often. It got 
          even better on my second bottle; I am now able to hold it like a normal 
          person and don't need to go as often during the night; have even had nights 
          where I haven't had to go at all. I am about to start my third bottle. 
          I am so glad I found your product.&quot; </p>
        <p><b>Jane, 78 &#150; a case with improved bladder control, saved money 
          on diapers, regained confidence. </b>&quot;I used to wet myself almost 
          every time I felt the urge to go to the bathroom. The urine seemed to 
          have its own life and just came down. I hated to be homebound all the 
          time. I hated that this issue dominated my life. But I had no control. 
          I spent an average of $30 monthly on diapers and protective pads. I talked 
          to my girl friends and almost all of them have this problem. My daughter 
          attended a medical conference and she introduced me BetterWOMAN. I noticed 
          big improvement after only TWO bottles&#151;the leakage became much less 
          of an issue. After 3 bottles, the situation is mostly under control. I 
          am overjoyed! I am myself again.&quot; </p>
        <p><b>Delsa, 55 &#150; a typical case for women in menopausal phase.</b> &quot;I am a nurse working in an emergency room. It is not easy for me 
          to deal with my urine leakage problem. Whenever I sneezed, coughed or 
          bent, I got wet. I noticed obvious improvements after 2 bottles of BetterWOMAN.
          Now I very rarely get wet. It's a great product.&quot; </p>
        <p><b>Melissa, 50 &#150; a case of improved in urinary urgency.</b> &quot;I 
          had to stop drinking water two days before I visit my dentist because 
          I was afraid of having an 'accident'. I found BetterWOMAN through an online 
          search. After 2 bottles, I noticed big differences. I feel I am a new 
          person now. My confidence has come back.&quot; </p>
        <p><b>Cindy, 69 &#150; a case of improved leakage, frequency and regained 
          confidence.</b> &quot;I don't need to think about the location of the 
          next bathroom anymore. I can laugh fully and freely without concern. I've 
          got my dependable body back again! Also, after 6 bottles, I started to 
          notice a sensation of improved libido&#151;a long forgotten feeling. That 
          is really wonderful!&quot; </p>
        <p><b>Maria, 37 &#150; a case of improved frequent urination.</b> &quot;I 
          have had a bladder problem since my second child. For the past year, I 
          had to use the bathroom just about every hour. I hated to spend so much 
          of my life in the bathroom! After taking BetterWOMAN, I can last 4 hours 
          now!&quot; </p>
        <p><b>Dana, 55 &#150; a case of improved urinary frequency and nighttime 
          sleep.</b> &quot;I used to get up 4-5 times a night. I was told it was 
          normal at this age. My friend told me about BetterWOMAN. Now, I rarely 
          get up anymore. I can sleep through most of the night. What a difference 
          with my energy level during the day! I love it.&quot; </p>
        <p><b>Joyce, 50 &#150; a case of improved urine leakage and menopausal symptoms.</b> &quot;I just started to enter the peri-menopausal phase. I noticed that 
          I started to get wet sometimes when I laughed very hard. I did not even 
          know that was the early symptoms of stress urinary incontinence. After 
          I tried 2 bottles of BetterWOMAN, not only did the leakage became much 
          less a problem, my menopausal symptoms have improved a lot&#151;much less 
          night sweats and migraines associated with menopause.&quot; </p>
        <p><b>Elaine, 74 &#150; improved sexual libido.</b> &quot;I've noticed a 
          wonderful 'side effect' of regularly taking BetterWOMAN &#150; I want 
          to have intercourse with my 84 year old hubby EVERY DAY!&quot; (Her hubby 
          is taking BetterMAN &#150; also by Interceuticals at <a href="http://www.bettermannow.com" target="display">www.BetterMANnow.com</a> ) </p>
        <p><b>Lynn, 52 &#150; improved menopausal symptoms.</b> &quot;After taking 
          BetterWOMAN for 3 months, I noticed the frequency of my night sweats reduced 
          quite a bit. I sleep better and find it much easier to concentrate during 
          the day.&quot; </p>
        <p><b>Julie, 37 &#150; improved energy levels.</b> &quot;My energy level 
          has improved a lot. I do not feel tired so frequently. I also lost several
          extra pounds because now I have the energy to exercise after work!&quot; </p>
