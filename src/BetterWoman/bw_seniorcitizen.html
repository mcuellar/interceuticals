        <h2>LACK OF BLADDER CONTROL AND STRESS URINARY INCONTINENCE</h2>
        <p>BY: MARIA ESPOSITO <br />

        <p>* Please see editor's at the end of this article.</p>
        <p>Americans have become a people who are fascinated with baring all. It 
          started with the talk show circuit where guests felt the need to reveal 
          some hidden secret to their poor unsuspecting friends or mates in front 
          of a studio audience and an even larger syndicated one. Next came the 
          &quot;reality shows&quot; with their quasi-voyeur like appeal bringing 
          the television audience into the dark depths of the human soul as we watched 
          people struggle against their environment and each other.</p>
        <p>All of this is supposed to make us feel that nothing is off limits; that 
          there is no subject that can't be dissected, inspected and reconnected. 
          But in spite of all this revelation, we still have our social taboos. 
          There are still those little secrets we only talk about in hushed whispers 
          and only with our most trusted confidents. One of those secrets is called 
          &quot;stress urinary incontinence&quot; and the reason it probably has 
          had so little public play, is that it is a condition that affects women. 
          After all, no matter how liberated we profess to be, most of us can still 
          hear our mother's voice inside our head saying &quot;that's something 
          we don't discuss&quot;. That's because stress urinary incontinence (SUI) 
          is involuntarily urinating when you bend, sneeze, cough, laugh or exercise. 
          It is often accompanied by urge urinary incontinence (UUI), when an overactive 
          bladder contracts on its own and leaks urine with no warning.</p>
        <p>Women don't discuss SUI, because it is one of those problems they have 
          always been told is not fit for polite conversation. Instead they quietly
          find a way to cope and that usually means wearing a &quot;bladder control 
          pad&quot; or worse yet, an adult diaper.</p>
        <p>And so it goes until somebody is brave enough to stand and say that this 
          needs to stop. Well, somebody has; and that person is a charming lady
          named Dr. Peipei Wu Wishnow. Dr. Wishnow is a PhD, MIT-trained biochemist. 
          Speaking with her is like being sucked up into a whirling vortex, her 
          mind racing, her words tumbling from her lips end-over-end in an attempt 
          to beat each other out of her mouth. She is resolutely determined to make 
          sure women know they do not have to live with these problems. </p>
        <p>Her Marblehead, Massachusetts-based company Interceuticals, Inc. introduced 
          a product at the beginning of this year called BetterWOMAN. The product 
          was born from Dr. Wishnow's blending of the herbal healing arts of her 
          Chinese ancestors with modern Western medicine. The result is a product 
          that aids the female body in improving the blood circulation in the kidney 
          area and rebalancing its natural hormones to improve muscle tonality. 
          It also modulates the neuro-muscle function. When the bladder muscle is 
          experiencing continued spasms, you keep having that constant urge to urinate. 
          BetterWOMAN helps the bladder muscle to calm down and as it calms, the 
          persistent urge disappears. The best part of all of this is that there 
          are no side effects.</p>
        <p>That is exciting news for all of those post-menopausal women who have 
          been told that they need HRT. Studies have shown that this kind of therapy 
          not only increases risks for heart disease and certain types of cancer; 
          according to Dr. Wishnow it actually increases incontinence. She is firmly 
          against women receiving HRT; but she knew that bladder control problems 
          required treatment. That's how BetterWOMAN was developed. Interceuticals 
          had previously developed an herbal formula that it sells internationally 
          to counter impotence and urinary frequency in men, known as BetterMAN. 
          Dr.Wishnow took that formula and modified it to meet the requirements 
          of a woman's body.</p>
        <p>BetterWOMAN was tested for its effectiveness in four major areas: urinary 
          function, sexual function, energy levels and menopausal related symptoms. 
          Conducting the study were: Lawrence Dorman, Doctor of Osteopathy, Applewood 
          Medical Center, Independence, Missouri, and Paul Cutler, MD, of Rochester 
          and Niagara Falls, New York. The clinical trails showed that after two 
          months of treatment, women with bladder control issues showed a dramatic 
          improvement. And after taking the product for an additional two months, 
          they began to show signs of increased energy and sexual function. Women 
          who did not have bladder control problems and took the product showed 
          increases in sexual function, energy levels and a decrease in menopausal 
          symptoms after two months of treatment. This led the participating researchers 
          to conclude that BetterWOMAN could be given both preventatively and therapeutically.</p>
        <p>The ramifications of such a discovery are astounding. There are over 
          33 million adults with an overactive bladder. In 1995, bladder control 
          sufferers in the United States spent $26 billion for incontinence. Of 
          that amount, 43% was spent on diapers and only 3% was spent on treatment. 
          Maybe if the treatment comes in the form of pills that can be easily taken,
          and diet, nutrition and exercise, those statistics will reverse themselves. </p>
        <p>Dr. Wishnow presented her study of BetterWOMAN in a presentation at the 
          North American Menopause Society's annual meeting, which is published 
          in the NAMS' journal's November issue. </p>
        <p>*Editor's note: It is this editor's opinion that every body is different. 
          Find what works for you and use it. Consult your traditional Dr., your 
          herbalist, your nutritionist, your other health professionals and exercise.
          Be sure everyone knows what meds, herbal and traditional, you are taking; 
          research some more, and listen to your body, it is giving you information. </p>
