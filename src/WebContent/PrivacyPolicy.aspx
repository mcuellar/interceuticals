                    Use of your Personal Information

Interceuticals may also contact you via surveys to conduct research about your opinion of current services or of potential new services that may be offered.

                    Interceuticals does not sell, rent or lease its customer lists to third parties. Interceuticals may, from time to time, contact you on behalf of external business partners about a particular offering that may be of interest to you. In those cases, your unique personally identifiable information (e-mail, name, address, telephone number) is not transferred to the third party. In addition, Interceuticals may share data with trusted partners to help us perform statistical analysis, send you email or postal mail, provide customer support, or arrange for deliveries. All such third parties are prohibited from using your personal information except to provide these services to Interceuticals, and they are required to maintain the confidentiality of your information.

                    Interceuticals does not use or disclose sensitive personal information, such as race, religion, or political affiliations, without your explicit consent.

                    Use of Cookies
                    <p>
                    The Interceuticals Web site use "cookies" to help you personalize your online experience. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a Web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.

                    One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you personalize Interceuticals pages, or register with Interceuticals site or services, a cookie helps Interceuticals to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of recording your personal information, such as billing addresses, shipping addresses, and so on. When you return to the same Interceuticals Web site, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the Interceuticals features that you customized.

                    You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of the Interceuticals services or Web sites you visit.

                    Security of your Personal Information
                    <p>
                    Interceuticals secures your personal information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. Interceuticals secures the personally identifiable information you provide on computer servers in a controlled, secure environment, protected from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. When personal information (such as a credit card number) is transmitted to other Web sites, it is protected through the use of encryption, such as the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol.
